# OptionShell

## Purpose:
I tried to use the built-in module `argparse`, and I didn't like working with it for many reasons, such as:
- I can't try-catch the errors: When an error happens, it just exits, and I can't handle it.
   ```
   usage: example.py [-h] [--foo FOO] [--bar BAR]
   example.py: error: argument --foo: not allowed with argument --bar
   ```
So, I made this script.

## Features:
- It will support auto-completion.
- You can customize it.

It's my first script, so go easy on me.
